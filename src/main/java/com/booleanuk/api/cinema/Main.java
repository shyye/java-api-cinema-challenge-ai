// Copilot Exercise all code in the api package is generated with Copilot
// By aking this in the chat:

//1.
//Provide code for how to solve the requirements in README.md
//
//2.
//The application should satisfy this api requirements: https://boolean-uk.github.io/java-api-cinema-challenge/
//
//3.
//I don't think the code has support for the requred repsonses and PAI calls. Check docs/openapi-core.yml and update the SpringBoot application accordingly.
